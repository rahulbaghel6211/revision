 Q No.8 Explain briefly what happens when you hit a url? explain DNS lookup
 After youâ€™ve typed the URL into your browser and pressed enter, the browser needs to figure out which server 
 on the Internet to connect to. To do that, it needs to look up the IP address of the server hosting the website
  using the domain you typed in.

   Because DNS is complex and has to be blazingly fast, DNS data is cached at different
   layers between your browser and at various places across the Internet. Your browser checks its own cache, 
   the operating system cache, a local network cache at your router, and a DNS server cache on your corporate 
   network or at your internet service provider (ISP). If the browser cannot find the IP address at any
   of those cache layers, the DNS server on your corporate network or at your ISP does a recursive DNS lookup.
